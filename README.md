Leap Year APP challenge

How to compile and run the code:

This code can be compiled and run buy either cloning the repository or downloading it as a zip then extract onto your pc. Using android studio, you can open the project and run it.

The code base is structured with the MVP design pattern and the code is written in kotlin.

I chose the MVP design pttern because the project consist of only one view for taking user input and desplaying results and MVP provides one to one relationship between the view and presenter and for this project is the best option to go with

I chose to use kotlin instead of java because kotlin makes writing code faster and efficient and it handles null pointer exceptions very well. With kotlin, the code notifies you of potential null pointer exceptions to prevent crashes at runtime
